### Basic Usage

1. **Data Collection**:
   ```powershell
   .\Plogger\Plogger.ps1
   ```

2. **Generate System Report**:
   ```powershell
   .\Plogger\Reporter.ps1
   ```

3. **Generate Process Report**:
   ```powershell
   .\Plogger\Reporter_for_Process.ps1
   ```

## üìä Monitoring Capabilities

### System Metrics
- **CPU**: Usage percentage, real-time clock speeds, processor performance
- **Memory**: RAM usage, available memory
- **Storage**: Disk I/O operations, read/write speeds
- **Network**: Adapter utilization, bandwidth usage
