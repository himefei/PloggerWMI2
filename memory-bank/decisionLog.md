2025-05-30 21:19:42 - Initial architectural decisions and Memory Bank establishment

## Decision

Memory Bank initialization for Windows performance monitoring project

## Rationale 

Establishes consistent project context and documentation framework to support iterative development and cross-mode collaboration for the performance monitoring tool.

## Implementation Details

* Created comprehensive Memory Bank structure with productContext, activeContext, progress, decisionLog, and systemPatterns files
* Documented project goals focused on lightweight, comprehensive Windows performance monitoring
* Identified PowerShell-based architecture leveraging WIM/CIM for native Windows integration
* Established component structure: Plogger (data collection) and Reporter (visualization)
[2025-05-30 21:28:36] - CPU Temperature Data Processing Architecture Change

## Decision

Move CPU temperature processing from Plogger to Reporter to improve logging performance and temperature chart accuracy.

## Rationale 

Current implementation performs temperature conversion (tenths of Kelvin to Celsius) during logging, which adds processing overhead. Additionally, rounding to 2 decimal places during logging causes thermal fluctuation data to be lost, resulting in flat-line temperature charts instead of showing natural variations.

## Implementation Details

* Plogger.ps1: Capture raw thermal zone temperature data without conversion or rounding
* Reporter.ps1: Process raw temperature data with appropriate precision during report generation
* Preserve thermal fluctuation detail for accurate visualization
* Reduce processing overhead during logging phase
