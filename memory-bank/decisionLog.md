# Decision Log

This file records architectural and implementation decisions using a list format.

2025-05-30 21:19:42 - Initial architectural decisions and Memory Bank establishment

## Decision

Memory Bank initialization for Windows performance monitoring project

## Rationale 

Establishes consistent project context and documentation framework to support iterative development and cross-mode collaboration for the performance monitoring tool.

## Implementation Details

* Created comprehensive Memory Bank structure with productContext, activeContext, progress, decisionLog, and systemPatterns files
* Documented project goals focused on lightweight, comprehensive Windows performance monitoring
* Identified PowerShell-based architecture leveraging WIM/CIM for native Windows integration
* Established component structure: Plogger (data collection) and Reporter (visualization)
[2025-05-30 21:28:36] - CPU Temperature Data Processing Architecture Change

## Decision

Move CPU temperature processing from Plogger to Reporter to improve logging performance and temperature chart accuracy.

## Rationale 

Current implementation performs temperature conversion (tenths of Kelvin to Celsius) during logging, which adds processing overhead. Additionally, rounding to 2 decimal places during logging causes thermal fluctuation data to be lost, resulting in flat-line temperature charts instead of showing natural variations.

## Implementation Details

[2025-05-30 21:40:59] - Performance Optimization Analysis for Plogger.ps1

## Analysis Results

After reviewing Plogger.ps1, identified several areas where calculations during logging could be moved to Reporter.ps1:

### High Impact Optimizations:
1. **GPU Engine Processing (Lines 576-620)**: Complex string parsing and grouping operations
2. **Battery Calculations (Lines 488-496)**: Percentage calculations from mWh values
3. **Network Adapter Filtering (Lines 381-414)**: Complex string matching and filtering
4. **Per-process CPU Calculations (Lines 662)**: Division by logical core count

### Medium Impact Optimizations:
5. **RAM Used Calculation (Lines 363-366)**: Simple subtraction could be moved
6. **Power Status Processing (Lines 335-337)**: Function call overhead

### Low Impact (Keep in Plogger):
- Simple counter readings (CPU, Disk, Network base values)
- Direct WMI property access
- Timestamp generation

## Implementation Plan
Focus on High Impact items first as they involve the most processing overhead during logging.
* Plogger.ps1: Capture raw thermal zone temperature data without conversion or rounding
* Reporter.ps1: Process raw temperature data with appropriate precision during report generation
* Preserve thermal fluctuation detail for accurate visualization
* Reduce processing overhead during logging phase
[2025-05-30 22:01:35] - GPU Engine Data Optimization Fix

[2025-06-04 15:06:00] - RAM and VRAM Chart Separation with Dual-Axis Percentage View

## Decision

Separated the combined "RAM and VRAM Usage (MB)" chart into two distinct charts: "RAM Usage (%)" and "VRAM Usage (%)" with dual-axis visualization showing percentage (0-100%) on the left and capacity in GB on the right.

## Rationale

User requested separation of RAM and VRAM into individual charts with percentage view from 0-100% on the left axis and actual capacity in GB displayed on the right axis.

[2025-06-04 19:42:00] - CPU Power Draw Calculation Enhancement

## Decision

Enhanced CPU power draw calculation by switching from CPUProcessorPerformance to CPUUsagePercent and implementing improved idle power thresholds with adjusted turbo boost trigger.

## Rationale 

User requested improvements to CPU power estimation accuracy with specific idle power thresholds and more realistic turbo boost behavior. The changes provide more intuitive power consumption patterns that better reflect actual CPU usage rather than processor performance counters.

## Implementation Details

**Data Source Change:**
- Switched from `CPUProcessorPerformance` to `CPUUsagePercent` for power calculation base metric
- Updated function parameter from `$cpuPerformance` to `$cpuUsage` throughout Calculate-CPUPowerEstimation function
- Modified conditional checks to use `CPUUsagePercent` column validation

**Enhanced Idle Power Formula:**
- Below 7% CPU usage: 10% of CPU TDP (unchanged for very low usage)
- Between 6% to 13% CPU usage: 50% of CPU TDP (significant increase for light usage)
- Above 13%: Standard calculation with 10% base idle power

**Turbo Boost Threshold Adjustment:**
- Changed turbo boost trigger from >70% to >90% CPU usage for more realistic behavior
- Turbo boost calculation now uses (usage - 90) / 10.0 instead of (performance - 70) / 30.0
- Maintains same 15% boost magnitude with variation but triggers at higher usage levels

**Technical Implementation:**
```powershell
# Improved idle power thresholds
if ($usagePercent -lt 7) {
    $idlePowerPercent = 0.10  # 10% of CPU TDP when below 7%
} elseif ($usagePercent -ge 6 -and $usagePercent -le 13) {
    $idlePowerPercent = 0.50  # 50% of CPU TDP between 6% to 13%
}

# Updated turbo boost trigger
if ($usagePercent -gt 90) {
    $turboBoost = ($usagePercent - 90) / 10.0  # 0 to 1 for 90-100% usage
}
```

## Impact

- **More Realistic Power Estimation**: CPU usage percentage provides more intuitive correlation with power consumption
- **Enhanced Idle Accuracy**: Improved power estimation for light workloads with 50% TDP allocation for 6-13% usage range
- **Realistic Turbo Behavior**: Turbo boost effects only trigger at very high usage (>90%) matching real CPU behavior
- **Maintained Compatibility**: All existing functionality preserved with enhanced calculation accuracy
- **Better User Understanding**: Power draw patterns now align more closely with expected CPU usage correlation
[2025-06-04 19:53:00] - CPU Power Draw Tiered Calculation Enhancement

## Decision

Implemented refined tiered CPU power draw calculation with granular usage-based thresholds for more accurate power consumption modeling across different CPU load scenarios.

## Rationale 

After initial implementation and user testing, the power consumption model needed refinement to better represent real-world CPU power behavior across different usage scenarios. The new tiered approach provides more accurate power estimation for idle, light, medium, and high usage scenarios.

## Implementation Details

**Enhanced Tiered Power Calculation:**
- **Below 6% CPU usage**: 10% of TDP (deep idle state)
- **6%-12% CPU usage**: 30% of TDP (light background activity)
- **12%-40% CPU usage**: 45% of TDP (moderate sustained load)
- **Above 40% CPU usage**: Proportional scaling based on CPUUsagePercent (linear relationship)
- **Above 90% CPU usage**: 15% turbo boost applied (unchanged)

**Technical Implementation:**
```powershell
# Enhanced tiered power calculation
if ($usagePercent -lt 6) {
    $basePowerDraw = $cpuTDP * 0.10      # Below 6%: 10% of TDP
} elseif ($usagePercent -ge 6 -and $usagePercent -lt 12) {
    $basePowerDraw = $cpuTDP * 0.30      # 6%-12%: 30% of TDP
} elseif ($usagePercent -ge 12 -and $usagePercent -le 40) {
    $basePowerDraw = $cpuTDP * 0.45      # 12%-40%: 45% of TDP
} else {
    $basePowerDraw = $cpuTDP * ($usagePercent / 100.0)  # Above 40%: proportional
}
```

**Maintained Features:**
- All randomness factors preserved (thermal, voltage, workload variations)
- Turbo boost trigger at >90% CPU usage with 15% boost
- Deterministic timestamp-based random seeding for consistency
- Power limits: minimum 10% TDP, maximum 1.5x TDP

- **Moderate Load Handling**: 45% TDP for sustained moderate loads (12-40%) reflects modern CPU efficiency
- **Linear High-Usage Scaling**: Above 40% usage provides intuitive linear relationship with power consumption
- **Production-Ready Accuracy**: Enhanced model better matches real-world CPU power consumption patterns
- **Maintained Randomness**: All power variation factors preserved for authentic power behavior simulation
[2025-06-04 20:26:00] - CPU Power Draw Reversion to CPUProcessorPerformance

## Decision

Reverted CPU power draw calculation back to using CPUProcessorPerformance instead of CPUUsagePercent to handle thermal throttling scenarios correctly.

## Rationale 

User identified a critical flaw with using CPU usage percentage for power estimation: during thermal throttling, CPUs can be locked to very low frequencies (e.g., 500MHz) while showing 100% CPU usage. This would result in misleading high power draw estimates when the CPU is actually consuming much less power due to the reduced frequency.

CPUProcessorPerformance better reflects the actual CPU frequency and correlates more accurately with power consumption, especially in thermal throttling scenarios where frequency is reduced but utilization remains high.

## Implementation Details

**Reverted Changes:**
- Switched back from `CPUUsagePercent` to `CPUProcessorPerformance` as base metric
- Restored original power calculation: `TDP * (Performance% / 100)` with 12% idle power
- Updated all variable references from `$usagePercent` to `$performancePercent`
- Restored conditional validation to check for `CPUProcessorPerformance` column
- Reverted turbo boost trigger to use performance percentage instead of usage percentage

**Technical Implementation:**
```powershell
# Original approach restored
$performancePercent = [double]$cpuPerformance
$idlePowerPercent = 0.12  # 12% of TDP for idle power
$activePowerPercent = ($performancePercent / 100.0) * (1.0 - $idlePowerPercent)
$basePowerDraw = $cpuTDP * ($idlePowerPercent + $activePowerPercent)

# Turbo boost at >90% performance (not usage)
if ($performancePercent -gt 90) {
    $turboBoost = ($performancePercent - 90) / 10.0
}
```

**Maintained Features:**
- All randomness factors preserved (thermal, voltage, workload variations)
- Turbo boost trigger at >90% (now based on performance, not usage)
- Deterministic timestamp-based random seeding for consistency
- Power limits: minimum idle power, maximum 1.5x TDP

## Impact

- **Thermal Throttling Accuracy**: Power estimation now correctly handles scenarios where CPU is throttled to low frequencies
- **Frequency Correlation**: Power draw correlates with actual CPU frequency/performance rather than utilization
- **Realistic Throttling Behavior**: During thermal throttling, power draw will be low despite high CPU usage
- **Production Reliability**: Eliminates false high power readings in constrained thermal environments
- **Maintained Authenticity**: All power variation factors preserved for realistic consumption patterns

## Use Case Example

- **Before (CPUUsagePercent)**: Throttled CPU at 500MHz showing 100% usage → High estimated power draw (incorrect)
- **After (CPUProcessorPerformance)**: Throttled CPU at 500MHz showing ~20% performance → Low estimated power draw (correct)
[2025-06-04 20:34:00] - Hybrid CPU Power Draw Calculation Implementation

## Decision

Implemented hybrid CPU power draw calculation using both CPUProcessorPerformance and CPUUsagePercent metrics for optimal accuracy across all scenarios including thermal throttling and idle states.

## Rationale 

The hybrid approach combines the best of both metrics:
- **CPUProcessorPerformance**: Provides accurate frequency-based power calculation, essential for thermal throttling scenarios
- **CPUUsagePercent**: Enables intelligent idle state detection and turbo boost triggering based on actual workload demand

This dual-metric approach delivers more realistic and reliable power consumption estimates that reflect real-world CPU behavior.

## Implementation Details

**Hybrid Power Calculation Logic:**
1. **Base Power**: Calculated using `CPUProcessorPerformance * TDP` (frequency-accurate)
2. **Usage-Based Adjustments**: Applied based on `CPUUsagePercent` thresholds
3. **Turbo Boost**: Triggered by `CPUUsagePercent` >90% (workload-based)

**Power State Adjustments:**
- **Below 7% CPU usage**: Idle state - multiply final power by 10% (deep idle)
- **7%-14% CPU usage**: Low power mode - multiply final power by 50% (light background activity)
- **Above 14% CPU usage**: Full calculated power (active workload)
- **Above 90% CPU usage**: 15% turbo boost applied (high demand scenarios)

**Technical Implementation:**
```powershell
# Base calculation using frequency performance
$basePowerDraw = $cpuTDP * ($performancePercent / 100.0)

# Usage-based power state adjustments
if ($usagePercent -lt 7) {
    $basePowerDraw = $basePowerDraw * 0.10      # Idle: 10% of calculated power
} elseif ($usagePercent -ge 7 -and $usagePercent -le 14) {
    $basePowerDraw = $basePowerDraw * 0.50      # Low power: 50% of calculated power
}
# Above 14%: Full calculated power (no reduction)

# Turbo boost based on usage demand
if ($usagePercent -gt 90) {
    $turboBoost = ($usagePercent - 90) / 10.0   # 15% boost with variation
}
```

**Maintained Features:**
- All randomness factors preserved (thermal, voltage, workload variations)
- Deterministic timestamp-based random seeding for consistency
- Power limits: minimum 5% TDP, maximum 1.5x TDP
- Performance-based variation calculations for authenticity

## Impact

- **Thermal Throttling Accuracy**: Performance-based calculation handles frequency reduction correctly
- **Intelligent Idle Detection**: Usage-based adjustments provide realistic idle/low-power behavior
- **Workload-Responsive Boost**: Turbo boost triggers based on actual CPU demand, not just frequency
- **Real-World Correlation**: Dual-metric approach mirrors actual CPU power management behavior
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Handles all scenarios from deep idle to thermal throttling to high-demand workloads

## Use Case Examples

- **Idle (2% usage, 15% performance)**: Low power draw (performance-based * 10% idle reduction)
- **Light workload (8% usage, 30% performance)**: Moderate power draw (performance-based * 50% reduction)
- **Active workload (25% usage, 60% performance)**: Full power draw based on frequency
- **Thermal throttling (100% usage, 20% performance)**: Low power draw (frequency-limited, no false high reading)
- **High demand (95% usage, 95% performance)**: Full power + 15% turbo boost
