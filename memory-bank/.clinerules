## Key Patterns and Preferences

- All system logging must use WMI and CIM only; no external DLLs or libraries are permitted for Plogger.ps1.
- CSV schema must remain stable and compatible with Reporter.ps1 and Reporter_for_Process.ps1.
- Script/EXE path detection logic must be robust to support both .ps1 and compiled .exe execution.
- HTML reports should use Chart.js and provide clear, actionable visualizations.
- Update this file as new project-specific patterns, user preferences, or technical decisions are discovered.
