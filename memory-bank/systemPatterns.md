[2025-05-30 23:07:14] - Chart Layout Standardization
**Pattern**: All charts in Reporter.ps1 should use consistent half-width layout
**Implementation**: 
- Charts are organized in chart-row divs with chart-half containers
- Each chart-half uses 48% width with responsive design (100% width on screens <1200px)
- Standard chart-container styling with consistent dimensions (height: 400px)
- GPU Engine chart moved from full-width to half-width for consistency
**Benefit**: Consistent visual layout, better space utilization, uniform user experience
**Template**: 
```html
<div class="chart-row">
    <div class="chart-half">
        <div class="chart-container">
            <div class="chart-title">Chart Title</div>
            <canvas id="chartId"></canvas>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="chart-half">
        <div class="chart-container">
            <div class="chart-title">Chart Title</div>
            <canvas id="chartId2"></canvas>
        </div>
    </div>
</div>
```
[2025-05-30 23:12:47] - Drag & Drop Chart Functionality Implementation
**Pattern**: Interactive chart rearrangement using HTML5 drag and drop API
**Implementation**:
- Added draggable="true" attribute to all chart containers
- CSS classes for visual feedback: .dragging, .drag-over, hover effects
- JavaScript event handlers: dragstart, dragend, dragover, dragleave, drop
- Dynamic event listener reattachment after DOM manipulation
- User instructions banner for discoverability

**Key Features**:
- Visual feedback during drag (opacity, rotation, border highlighting)
- Automatic chart swapping between positions
- Maintains chart functionality after rearrangement
- Responsive design preservation
- Cross-browser HTML5 drag and drop support

**Technical Details**:

- Single-directory model enables easier testing, distribution, and deployment
**Benefit**: Simplified project structure, reduced complexity, easier customer deployment
**Structure**:
```
Plogger/
â”œâ”€â”€ Plogger.ps1              # Core performance logging
â”œâ”€â”€ Plogger.exe              # Compiled executable  
â”œâ”€â”€ Reporter.ps1             # System performance visualization
â”œâ”€â”€ Reporter_for_Process.ps1 # Process-specific reporting
â””â”€â”€ chart.js                 # Chart.js visualization library
```
[2025-05-31 13:39:30] - Scientific Polynomial Regression Trend Line Pattern
**Pattern**: All line charts automatically include curved trend lines calculated using polynomial regression for scientific accuracy
**Implementation**:
- Added calculateTrendLine() function using adaptive polynomial regression (degree 2-3)
- Implemented polynomialRegression() with least squares method and Vandermonde matrix approach
- Added gaussianElimination() solver for robust coefficient calculation
- Enhanced createChart() and createMultiChart() functions to automatically add curved trend datasets
- Trend lines displayed as dashed curves with 70% opacity of the original color
- Applied to both system monitoring (Reporter.ps1) and process monitoring (Reporter_for_Process.ps1)
**Mathematical Features**:
- Polynomial regression using least squares method for optimal curve fitting
- Adaptive degree selection based on data size (minimum degree 2, maximum degree 3)
- Gaussian elimination for numerically stable coefficient solving
- Handles non-linear performance patterns, acceleration/deceleration phases
**Visual Features**:
- Curved trend lines that follow actual data patterns
- Visual distinction using borderDash: [5, 5] pattern
- Transparent background to avoid interference with main data
- Zero interaction points (pointRadius: 0) to maintain focus on main data
**Benefits**: Scientifically accurate trend analysis, better curve fitting for performance data, industry-standard approach for monitoring systems
**Template**:
```javascript
// Calculate polynomial trend line
const trendData = calculateTrendLine(data); // Uses polynomial regression
const trendDataset = {
    label: label + ' Trend',
    data: trendData,
    borderColor: color.replace('rgb', 'rgba').replace(')', ', 0.7)'),
    backgroundColor: 'transparent',
    borderWidth: 2,
    borderDash: [5, 5],
    tension: 0,
    pointRadius: 0
};
```
[2025-05-31 13:54:45] - GPU Vendor Detection and Monitoring Pattern

# Data integration with null handling
GPUVendorMetric = if ($metrics -and $metrics.Available) { $metrics.Value } else { $null }
```

[2025-05-31 16:22:00] - Emoji and Special Character Encoding Fix
**Problem**: Emojis display as garbled characters like "Ã°Å¸"Å " in HTML reports, temperature symbols show as "Ã‚Â°C" instead of "Â°C"
**Root Causes**:
- PowerShell console not set to UTF-8 encoding
- Direct emoji characters in source code get corrupted during processing
- `Out-File -Encoding UTF8` adds BOM which can cause display issues
- Temperature degree symbol (Â°) gets double-encoded

**Complete Solution**:
1. **Set Console Encoding** (at script start):
```powershell
[Console]::OutputEncoding = [System.Text.Encoding]::UTF8
$OutputEncoding = [System.Text.Encoding]::UTF8
```

2. **Replace Direct Characters with HTML Entities**:
- Emoji `ðŸ“Š` â†’ `&#128202;`
- Emoji `ðŸ“ˆ` â†’ `&#128200;`
- Emoji `ðŸ”„` â†’ `&#128260;`
- Temperature `Â°C` â†’ `&#176;C`

3. **Use Proper File Writing**:
```powershell
# Instead of: $html | Out-File -FilePath $path -Encoding UTF8
# Use: [System.IO.File]::WriteAllText($path, $html, [System.Text.UTF8Encoding]::new($false))
```

4. **HTML Meta Tag** (ensure present):
```html
<meta charset="UTF-8">
```

**Fixed Locations**:
- Reporter.ps1: Console encoding, temperature units, drag & drop emoji, file writing
- Reporter_for_Process.ps1: Console encoding, drag & drop emoji, file writing

**Benefit**: Proper display of emojis and special characters across all browsers, professional appearance of HTML reports
[2025-06-05 11:19:00] - Robust Power Overlay Detection Pattern
**Pattern**: Multi-tier fallback system for power overlay detection with silent error handling
**Implementation**: 
- Three-method detection strategy: standard registry properties â†’ alternative registry locations â†’ WMI/CIM fallback
- Property name variant checking for different system configurations and common typos
- Silent error handling with try-catch blocks that don't output warnings to maintain clean logging
- Alternative registry path checking for custom SOE configurations
- Pattern-based GUID detection in non-standard registry locations
- Descriptive fallback values instead of generic error messages

**Key Features**:
- Method 1: Multiple property name variants (ActiveOverlayAcPowerScheme, ActivatOverlayAcPowerScheme, ActiveAcOverlay, ActiveOverlay)
- Method 2: Alternative registry paths (PowerSettings, FlyoutMenuSettings, Explorer Preferences)
- Method 3: WMI/CIM power scheme detection for final fallback
- Property existence validation before registry access to prevent exceptions
- GUID pattern matching for detecting power schemes in unexpected locations
- Silent degradation through all methods without verbose error reporting

**Error Handling Strategy**:
- Replace Write-Warning with silent try-catch blocks
- Use descriptive fallback values ("Not Available", "Standard", "Customer SOE Power Scheme")
- Graceful degradation that doesn't interrupt logging performance
- Property existence checking before access to prevent PropertyNotFoundException

**Benefits**: Clean logging output, enhanced system compatibility, SOE configuration support, maintained efficiency
**Applied to**: Get-PowerStatusMetrics function in Plogger.ps1
**Use Case**: Systems without Lenovo power management drivers, custom enterprise configurations, varying Windows installations
