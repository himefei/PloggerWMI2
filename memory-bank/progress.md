[2025-05-30 21:44:05] - Performance Optimization Implementation Completed

## Completed Optimizations

### High Impact Changes:
1. **GPU Engine Processing**: Moved complex string parsing and grouping from Plogger to Reporter
   - Raw JSON data capture in Plogger
   - Processing functions added to Reporter.ps1

2. **Battery Calculations**: Eliminated percentage calculations during logging
   - Raw mWh values stored in Plogger
   - Enhanced calculation with better precision in Reporter

3. **Network Adapter Filtering**: Moved complex filtering logic to Reporter
   - Raw adapter data capture as JSON in Plogger
   - Smart filtering applied in Reporter for accurate physical adapter detection

4. **Per-process CPU Calculations**: Raw CPU data capture for Reporter processing
   - Raw PercentProcessorTime stored with LogicalCoreCount
   - Division operation moved to Reporter_for_Process.ps1
   - Backward compatibility maintained for existing CSV files

### Medium Impact Changes:
5. **RAM Calculation Structure**: Added total RAM for potential Reporter calculations
6. **Data Structure Enhancements**: Added raw data fields (GPUEngineRawData, NetworkAdaptersRawData, etc.)

## Performance Benefits
- Reduced processing overhead in logging loop
- Maintained functionality while improving data capture speed
- Enhanced data precision through Reporter-side calculations
- Backward compatibility preserved for existing CSV files

* Comprehensive codebase analysis of existing components
* Documentation of current implementation capabilities
* Assessment of WIM/CIM integration patterns
* Evaluation of performance metrics collection scope

## Next Steps

* Analyze Plogger.ps1 implementation details
* Review Reporter component functionality and visualization capabilities
* Document data flow between components
* Identify enhancement opportunities for comprehensive performance monitoring
* Define testing and validation requirements for customer system deployment
[2025-05-30 21:30:24] - CPU Temperature Processing Architecture Implementation Completed

## Completed Tasks

* Refactored Plogger.ps1 to capture raw thermal zone temperature data without conversion
* Modified temperature data structure from CPUTemperatureC to CPUTemperatureRaw
* Added temperature conversion function to Reporter.ps1 with improved precision (3 decimal places)
* Updated statistics calculation to handle raw temperature conversion
* Enhanced JavaScript chart processing to support both raw and legacy temperature data formats
* Maintained backward compatibility for existing CSV files with pre-converted temperature data

## Implementation Benefits

* Reduced processing overhead during logging phase
* Preserved thermal fluctuation details for accurate visualization
* Improved temperature chart accuracy to show natural thermal variations
* Enhanced data precision from 2 to 3 decimal places for better granularity
[2025-05-30 22:49:49] - Implemented CPU processor performance capture and real-time clock speed calculation
- Added CPUProcessorPerformance counter capture in Plogger.ps1 using '\Processor Information(_Total)\% Processor Performance'
- Created Calculate-CPURealTimeClockSpeed function in Reporter.ps1 to multiply processor performance % with max clock speed
- Added CPURealTimeClockSpeedMHz to CSV output and statistics summary
- Created new CPU Real-Time Clock Speed line chart in HTML report positioned next to CPU Usage chart
- Updated chart layout to accommodate new chart while maintaining responsive design
[2025-05-30 22:56:25] - Simplified RAM Usage chart by removing RAM Available
- Removed RAM Available line from "RAM Usage (MB)" chart to reduce confusion
- Chart now only shows RAM Used as a single line for clearer visualization
- Updated JavaScript data processing to remove ramAvailable variable and processing
- Changed from createMultiChart to createChart for RAM display
[2025-05-30 23:07:26] - Standardized chart layout to half-width format
- Moved GPU Engine Utilization chart from full-width to half-width layout for consistency
- Fixed HTML structure by properly organizing all charts in chart-row/chart-half containers
- Established system pattern for all future charts to use consistent half-width layout
- Updated memory bank with chart layout template for future reference
[2025-05-30 23:13:00] - Implemented drag & drop functionality for chart rearrangement
- Added HTML5 drag and drop API to both Reporter.ps1 and Reporter_for_Process.ps1
- Enhanced CSS with visual feedback classes (.dragging, .drag-over, hover effects)
- Implemented JavaScript event handlers for complete drag and drop lifecycle
- Added user instruction banner for feature discoverability
- Charts can now be dragged and swapped for custom comparison layouts
- Maintains all chart functionality after rearrangement
- Dynamic event listener reattachment ensures continued functionality
- Responsive design and cross-browser compatibility maintained
[2025-05-30 23:17:16] - Fixed drag & drop chart data preservation bug
- ISSUE: Charts became empty after drag and drop due to lost Chart.js instances
- SOLUTION: Implemented chart configuration storage and recreation system
- Added storeChartConfig() to preserve chart data, options, and configuration
- Added recreateChart() to rebuild charts in new canvas elements after DOM manipulation
- Modified drag drop logic to capture canvas IDs and trigger chart recreation
- Enhanced updateAllCharts in Reporter_for_Process.ps1 to store configs for all charts
- Charts now maintain full functionality and data after rearrangement
- Proper cleanup with chart.destroy() before recreation prevents memory leaks
[2025-05-30 23:22:11] - Fixed visual state cleanup for drag & drop animations
- ISSUE: After drag and drop, charts remained visually stuck in dragging state (transparent, tilted)
- CAUSE: Cloned elements retained CSS classes (.dragging, .drag-over) from original drag operation
- SOLUTION: Added classList.remove() to clean up drag-related CSS classes from cloned elements
- Applied to both draggedClone and targetClone in both Reporter scripts
- Charts now return to normal visual state immediately after successful rearrangement
- Maintains smooth animation during drag while ensuring clean final state
