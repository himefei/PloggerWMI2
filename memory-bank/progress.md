[2025-05-30 21:30:24] - CPU Temperature Processing Architecture Implementation Completed

## Completed Tasks

* Refactored Plogger.ps1 to capture raw thermal zone temperature data without conversion
* Modified temperature data structure from CPUTemperatureC to CPUTemperatureRaw
* Added temperature conversion function to Reporter.ps1 with improved precision (3 decimal places)
* Updated statistics calculation to handle raw temperature conversion
* Enhanced JavaScript chart processing to support both raw and legacy temperature data formats
* Maintained backward compatibility for existing CSV files with pre-converted temperature data

## Implementation Benefits

* Reduced processing overhead during logging phase
* Preserved thermal fluctuation details for accurate visualization
* Improved temperature chart accuracy to show natural thermal variations
* Enhanced data precision from 2 to 3 decimal places for better granularity
