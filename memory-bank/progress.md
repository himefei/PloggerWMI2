This file tracks the project's progress using a task list format.

2025-05-30 21:19:32 - Initial project assessment and Memory Bank setup

## Completed Tasks

* Memory Bank initialization and setup
* Project context documentation from ProjectBrief.md
* Initial project structure analysis
* Core component identification (Plogger and Reporter)

## Current Tasks
[2025-05-30 21:44:05] - Performance Optimization Implementation Completed

## Completed Optimizations

### High Impact Changes:
1. **GPU Engine Processing**: Moved complex string parsing and grouping from Plogger to Reporter
   - Raw JSON data capture in Plogger
   - Processing functions added to Reporter.ps1

2. **Battery Calculations**: Eliminated percentage calculations during logging
   - Raw mWh values stored in Plogger
   - Enhanced calculation with better precision in Reporter

3. **Network Adapter Filtering**: Moved complex filtering logic to Reporter
   - Raw adapter data capture as JSON in Plogger
   - Smart filtering applied in Reporter for accurate physical adapter detection

4. **Per-process CPU Calculations**: Raw CPU data capture for Reporter processing
   - Raw PercentProcessorTime stored with LogicalCoreCount
   - Division operation moved to Reporter_for_Process.ps1
   - Backward compatibility maintained for existing CSV files

### Medium Impact Changes:
5. **RAM Calculation Structure**: Added total RAM for potential Reporter calculations
6. **Data Structure Enhancements**: Added raw data fields (GPUEngineRawData, NetworkAdaptersRawData, etc.)

## Performance Benefits
- Reduced processing overhead in logging loop
- Maintained functionality while improving data capture speed
- Enhanced data precision through Reporter-side calculations
- Backward compatibility preserved for existing CSV files

* Comprehensive codebase analysis of existing components
* Documentation of current implementation capabilities
* Assessment of WIM/CIM integration patterns
* Evaluation of performance metrics collection scope

## Next Steps

* Analyze Plogger.ps1 implementation details
* Review Reporter component functionality and visualization capabilities
* Document data flow between components
* Identify enhancement opportunities for comprehensive performance monitoring
* Define testing and validation requirements for customer system deployment
[2025-05-30 21:30:24] - CPU Temperature Processing Architecture Implementation Completed

## Completed Tasks

* Refactored Plogger.ps1 to capture raw thermal zone temperature data without conversion
* Modified temperature data structure from CPUTemperatureC to CPUTemperatureRaw
* Added temperature conversion function to Reporter.ps1 with improved precision (3 decimal places)
* Updated statistics calculation to handle raw temperature conversion
* Enhanced JavaScript chart processing to support both raw and legacy temperature data formats
* Maintained backward compatibility for existing CSV files with pre-converted temperature data

## Implementation Benefits

* Reduced processing overhead during logging phase
* Preserved thermal fluctuation details for accurate visualization
* Improved temperature chart accuracy to show natural thermal variations
* Enhanced data precision from 2 to 3 decimal places for better granularity
