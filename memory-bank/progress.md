- One-time collection during initialization (storage doesn't change during 10-minute logging sessions)
- Graceful error handling for systems without storage access
- Professional HTML formatting consistent with existing statistics sections

## Implementation Benefits
- Enhanced hardware monitoring visibility with storage capacity awareness
- Efficient one-time data collection approach (storage capacity doesn't change during logging)
- Clear presentation of storage utilization for performance analysis
- Future-extensible framework for additional storage metrics if needed
- Maintains compatibility with existing CSV structure and reporting tools
[2025-07-01 14:44:30] - Process Usage Report Dropdown Enhancement - Median to Average/Max Implementation
## Completed Tasks

* **Dropdown Display Fix**: Replaced misleading median values with average and maximum values in all dropdown menus
* **Enhanced CPU Visibility**: Fixed issue where high CPU activity processes showed 0% median in dropdown while showing activity in charts
* **Data Structure Update**: Modified statistics objects to calculate and store maximum values alongside existing average calculations
* **Sorting Logic Enhancement**: Updated sorting to use average values instead of median for more representative process ranking
* **User Interface Improvement**: Enhanced dropdown display format to show both sustained load (average) and peak usage (maximum)

## Key Features Implemented
- CPU dropdown: Process names with "Avg: X%, Max: Y%" format instead of misleading median values
- RAM dropdown: Enhanced with average and maximum memory usage display
- VRAM dropdowns: Both dedicated and shared VRAM show average and maximum usage
- Improved process identification for resource-intensive applications like "Parity" process
- Consistent sorting based on average usage for better process prioritization

## Implementation Benefits
- Eliminated confusion from misleading 0% median values for high CPU processes
- Enhanced visibility of processes with sporadic but significant resource usage
- Better alignment between dropdown statistics and chart visualizations
- More informative process selection with both sustained and peak usage metrics
- Improved debugging capability for performance analysis and system monitoring
[2025-01-07 09:00:00] - CPU Usage Correction Factor Enhancement from 1.5x to 2.5x
## Completed Tasks

* **Enhanced CPU Accuracy**: Updated CPU usage correction factor in Reporter_for_Process.ps1 from 1.5x to 2.5x multiplier
* **Improved Task Manager Alignment**: CPU usage values now more closely match Windows Task Manager Process tab readings
* **Dual Format Support**: Applied 2.5x correction to both legacy CSV format and new raw data format processing
* **Console Message Updates**: Updated processing messages to reflect new 2.5x correction factor
* **Memory Bank Documentation**: Updated decisionLog.md with implementation details and rationale

## Implementation Benefits
- Enhanced accuracy in CPU usage reporting to better match user expectations
- Improved diagnostic value for process performance analysis  
- Maintained backward compatibility with existing CSV files
- Consistent user experience with familiar Task Manager reference values
- Automatic inheritance of corrections in aggregated process calculations

[2025-01-07 12:48:00] - CPU Chart Y-Axis Fixed Scale Enhancement
## Completed Tasks

* **Fixed CPU Chart Scaling**: Implemented fixed 0-100% Y-axis scale for CPU usage chart in Process Usage Report
* **Enhanced Chart Configuration**: Created dedicated cpuChartOptions with max: 100 Y-axis setting
* **Improved User Experience**: CPU usage now displayed with consistent 0-100% context for better interpretation
* **Maintained Chart Functionality**: Preserved all existing features including trend lines and drag & drop capabilities
* **Memory Bank Documentation**: Updated decisionLog.md with implementation details and rationale

## Implementation Benefits
- Better contextual awareness of CPU usage relative to maximum capacity
- Consistent visualization matching standard system monitoring practices
- Enhanced readability and professional appearance of CPU performance charts
- Easier comparison and interpretation of CPU utilization levels
