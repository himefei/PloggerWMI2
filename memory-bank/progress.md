# Progress

## What Works
- Initial Memory Bank files created for project context and documentation.
- Project goals, architecture, and technical constraints are clearly defined.
- Existing scripts (Plogger.ps1, Reporter.ps1, sample scripts) are available for refactoring.

## What's Left to Build
- Refactor Plogger.ps1 to improve WMI-based logging and path detection.
- Update Reporter.ps1 to provide advanced HTML reporting and ensure compatibility with new CSV schema.
- Validate that all scripts work as both .ps1 and compiled .exe.
- Update documentation and .clinerules as new patterns and requirements emerge.

## Current Status
- Memory Bank initialization in progress.
- Ready to begin code modifications.

## Known Issues
- None at this stage. Issues will be tracked here as development progresses.
