[2025-05-30 23:07:26] - Standardized chart layout to half-width format
- Moved GPU Engine Utilization chart from full-width to half-width layout for consistency
- Fixed HTML structure by properly organizing all charts in chart-row/chart-half containers
- Established system pattern for all future charts to use consistent half-width layout
- Updated memory bank with chart layout template for future reference
[2025-05-30 23:13:00] - Implemented drag & drop functionality for chart rearrangement
- Added HTML5 drag and drop API to both Reporter.ps1 and Reporter_for_Process.ps1
- Enhanced CSS with visual feedback classes (.dragging, .drag-over, hover effects)
- Implemented JavaScript event handlers for complete drag and drop lifecycle
- Added user instruction banner for feature discoverability
- Charts can now be dragged and swapped for custom comparison layouts
- Maintains all chart functionality after rearrangement
- Dynamic event listener reattachment ensures continued functionality
- Responsive design and cross-browser compatibility maintained
[2025-05-30 23:17:16] - Fixed drag & drop chart data preservation bug
- ISSUE: Charts became empty after drag and drop due to lost Chart.js instances
- SOLUTION: Implemented chart configuration storage and recreation system
- Added storeChartConfig() to preserve chart data, options, and configuration
- Added recreateChart() to rebuild charts in new canvas elements after DOM manipulation
- Modified drag drop logic to capture canvas IDs and trigger chart recreation
- Enhanced updateAllCharts in Reporter_for_Process.ps1 to store configs for all charts
- Charts now maintain full functionality and data after rearrangement
- Proper cleanup with chart.destroy() before recreation prevents memory leaks
[2025-05-30 23:22:11] - Fixed visual state cleanup for drag & drop animations
- ISSUE: After drag and drop, charts remained visually stuck in dragging state (transparent, tilted)
- CAUSE: Cloned elements retained CSS classes (.dragging, .drag-over) from original drag operation
- SOLUTION: Added classList.remove() to clean up drag-related CSS classes from cloned elements
- Applied to both draggedClone and targetClone in both Reporter scripts
