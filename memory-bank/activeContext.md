# Active Context

## Current Work Focus
- Refactor Plogger.ps1 to use robust script/EXE path detection and incorporate additional WMI-based logging capabilities from sample/Plogger.ps1 (excluding any non-WMI/LibreHardwareMonitor features).
- Update Reporter.ps1 using sample/Reporter.ps1 as a base, ensuring compatibility with the CSV output from Plogger.ps1 and providing advanced HTML reporting.
- Ensure all scripts function correctly when compiled to EXE.
- Initialize and maintain the Memory Bank for project context.

## Recent Changes
- Created initial Memory Bank files: projectbrief.md, productContext.md, systemPatterns.md, techContext.md, and activeContext.md.

## Next Steps
- Complete Memory Bank setup (progress.md, .clinerules).
- Begin code modifications to Plogger.ps1 and Reporter.ps1 as per plan.
