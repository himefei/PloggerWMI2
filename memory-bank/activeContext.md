This file tracks the project's current status, including recent changes, current goals, and open questions.

2025-05-30 21:19:22 - Memory Bank initialization and project context establishment

## Current Focus

* Memory Bank initialization and project documentation
* Understanding existing codebase structure (Plogger and Reporter components)
* Establishing baseline project context for performance monitoring tool

## Recent Changes

* Memory Bank system initialized
* Project context documented based on ProjectBrief.md
* Identified core components: Plogger (performance logging) and Reporter (visualization)

## Open Questions/Issues

* Detailed analysis of existing Plogger.ps1 implementation needed
* Reporter component functionality and visualization capabilities to be assessed
* Integration points between Plogger and Reporter components to be documented
* Performance metrics scope and data collection methodology to be defined
* Report output formats and visualization requirements to be specified
