* Updated CPU Usage metric processing to use CapAt100 parameter in statistics summary
* Maintained data integrity while improving user experience and reducing confusion
[2025-05-31 17:23:00] - Realistic CPU Power Draw Calculation Enhancement
## Current Focus

* Enhanced CPU power estimation with realistic variations to simulate real-world power consumption behavior
* Added multiple variation factors to make power draw chart more authentic and less identical to CPU performance

## Recent Changes

* Implemented deterministic randomness using timestamp-based seeding for consistency across report generations
* Added thermal variation factor (±2-8% based on performance level) 
* Added voltage regulation variation (±1-3%)
* Added workload efficiency variation (±2-5% based on performance)
* Added turbo boost effects for high performance scenarios (>70% CPU usage)
* Applied power draw limits (minimum idle power, maximum 1.5x TDP) for realistic bounds
* Power draw now varies independently from CPU clock speed while remaining scientifically plausible
