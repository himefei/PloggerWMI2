# Active Context

This file tracks the project's current status, including recent changes, current goals, and open questions.

2025-05-30 21:19:22 - Memory Bank initialization and project context establishment

## Current Focus

* Memory Bank initialization and project documentation
* Understanding existing codebase structure (Plogger and Reporter components)
* Establishing baseline project context for performance monitoring tool

## Recent Changes

* Memory Bank system initialized
* Project context documented based on ProjectBrief.md
* Identified core components: Plogger (performance logging) and Reporter (visualization)

## Open Questions/Issues

* Detailed analysis of existing Plogger.ps1 implementation needed
* Reporter component functionality and visualization capabilities to be assessed
* Integration points between Plogger and Reporter components to be documented
* Performance metrics scope and data collection methodology to be defined
* Report output formats and visualization requirements to be specified
[2025-05-30 22:50:02] - Completed CPU processor performance and real-time clock speed implementation
- Successfully added processor performance counter capture to Plogger component
- Implemented real-time clock speed calculation and visualization in Reporter component  
- Enhanced HTML report with new CPU clock speed chart for comprehensive CPU monitoring
[2025-05-30 23:33:09] - Project Structure Consolidation Update
## Current Focus

* Project structure has been simplified with report folder removal
* All components now consolidated in Plogger/ directory for easier testing and distribution
* Validating that all internal file references work correctly with new structure

## Recent Changes

* Removed separate /report/ directory entirely
* Moved Reporter.ps1, Reporter_for_Process.ps1, and chart.js into Plogger/ folder
* Established new single-folder deployment model
* All core functionality (logging, reporting, visualization) now centralized in Plogger/
